iQuery
======

> What is jQuery?

iQuery is a JavaScript library fast, small and rich in resources, based on jQuery, however using the native capabilities of the browser. He does things like HTML document transverse and manipulation, event handling and Ajax much simpler with a gallery of the identical functions offered by jQuery, however this in turn does not work in IE, only in modern browsers like Firefox and Google Chrome.

***
Use date symbol informing the operator, eg $ operator that is used by jQuery

`<script data-symbol="$" src="iQuery.js"></script>`
